**Taxation in Bosnia and Herzegovina**

Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) applies a largely flat‑rate tax system at the federal level, supplemented by local taxes.  The federal government collects the bulk of revenue from personal income tax, corporate tax, social security contributions, and value‑added tax (VAT).  The tax year corresponds to the calendar year (1 January – 31 December).
