**Taxation in Australia**

Australia’s tax system is administered primarily by the federal government through the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). Personal income tax is the largest source of revenue, followed by the Goods and Services Tax (GST) and social‑security contributions such as the Medicare levy and superannuation guarantees. State governments levy payroll taxes and contribute to the Commonwealth Grants Commission for GST revenue distribution.
