## Taxation in Argentina

Argentina's tax system is characterized by a complex legal framework lacking a codified tax code, relying instead on separate laws and executive decrees. The Federal Administration of Public Revenue (AFIP) is responsible for tax administration at all levels (federal, provincial, and municipal). The system operates on a self-assessment basis with no formal tax ruling system.  This summary provides an overview of key taxes and rates relevant to tax calculations as of 2025. All amounts are in Argentine Pesos (ARS). Note: Given Argentina's history of high inflation and frequent adjustments, specific figures and regulations are subject to rapid change. Consulting professional advice is strongly recommended.
