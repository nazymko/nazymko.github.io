**Taxation in Latvia**

Latvia operates a modern, flat‑tax system for individuals, complemented by a value‑added tax (VAT) and mandatory social‑security contributions. The tax year follows the calendar year (1 January – 31 December). The 2024 fiscal regime remains largely unchanged from 2023, with a flat personal income tax of 23 % and a standard VAT rate of 21 %. The following table provides the key rates and thresholds required for tax calculations.

### Personal Income Tax

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Tax system type** | Flat tax |
| **Flat rate** | **23 %** on all taxable income |
| **Tax‑free allowance** | **€900** per taxpayer per year (standard allowance) |
| **Dependent allowance** | **€1,980** per dependent per year |
| **Deductions** | None beyond standard and dependent allowances (no progressive brackets) |
| **Social‑security deduction** | N/A – social‑security contributions are separate |

**Calculation example:**  
Taxable income = €50 000 – €900 (standard) – €1 980 (dependent) = €47 120  
Income tax = 23 % × €47 120 = **€10,837.60**

### Value Added Tax (VAT)

| Item | Rate / Detail |
|------|---------------|

### Social Security and Other Payroll Taxes

| Item | Employer contribution | Employee contribution | Notes |
|------|------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Pension and health contributions** | **22.59 % – 24.09 %** of gross wages (variable based on income band) | **10.5 % – 11 %** of gross wages (variable based on income band) | Both are mandatory; no separate flat rate. |
| **Maximum wage ceiling** | €46 600 (2024) | €46 600 (2024) | Contributions above this ceiling are capped. |
| **Other payroll taxes** | None (no separate military/solidarity tax) | None | |
| **Social‑security ceiling** | Re‑instated in 2014; remains €46 600 | Same as employer ceiling | |

**Example calculation:**  
Gross wage: €30 000  
Employee contribution: 10.5 % × €30 000 = €3 150  
Employer contribution: 23.5 % × €30 000 = €7 050

### Additional Information

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Tax year period** | 1 January – 31 December 2024 |
| **Important notes** | • Income tax is calculated **after** subtracting the standard allowance and dependent allowance. <br>• Social‑security contributions are **deductible** for tax purposes only to the extent of the standard allowance; however, they are not reduced by the personal income‑tax allowance. <br>• VAT zero‑rated items (education, medical care) do not attract any VAT, but the supplier must certify the exemption. |
| **Recent updates (2024)** | • The standard personal allowance remained at €900. <br>• Social‑security ceiling unchanged at €46 600. <br>• No changes to VAT rates or exemption list. |
| **Currency** | Euro (€) |
