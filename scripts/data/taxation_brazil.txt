**Taxation in Brazil**

Brazil’s tax system is a mix of federal, state, and municipal levies. The federal government collects the most significant taxes—personal income tax (IRPF), corporate income tax, and social‑security contributions—while states and municipalities are responsible for indirect taxes such as ICMS (state value‑added tax) and a range of excise duties (IPI, PIS/Cofins). The following summary focuses on the elements most relevant for individual tax calculations.
