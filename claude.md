# Global Tax Calculator Map - Technical Documentation

## 📋 Overview

The Global Tax Calculator Map is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize and compare income tax calculations across different countries worldwide. Users can input their monthly salary in various currencies and see how much tax they would pay in each country, with results displayed both on an interactive map and in a comprehensive results table.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Approach

### Component-Based Architecture

The application has been refactored into a modular, component-based architecture for better maintainability, testability, and scalability:

```

├── components/
│   ├── Application.js           # Main application coordinator
│   ├── MapComponent.js          # Interactive map functionality
│   ├── CalculatorComponent.js   # Tax calculation and input handling
│   └── ResultsTableComponent.js # Results display and interaction
├── app.js                       # Application entry point
├── taxData.js                   # Country tax bracket definitions
├── taxCalculator.js             # Tax calculation logic
├── currencyService.js           # Currency conversion service
├── dataProcessor.js             # Data file processing utilities
├── dataIntegrator.js            # Data integration and management
├── mapController.js             # Legacy map controller (deprecated)
└── resultsTable.js              # Legacy results table (deprecated)
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Tax data is collected from multiple `.data` files in the `js/data/` folder
2. **Data Processing**: The `DataProcessor` class parses and validates country tax information
3. **Data Integration**: The `DataIntegrator` class merges processed data with existing tax datasets
4. **Runtime Processing**: Tax calculations are performed using the `TaxCalculator` class with real-time currency conversion

## 📊 Data Structure

### Country Tax Data Format

Each country in the dataset follows this structure:

```javascript
"country_key": {
    name: "Country Name",
    currency: "CUR",
    system: "progressive|flat|zero_personal",
    countryCode: "XX",
    coordinates: [latitude, longitude],
    brackets: [
        {min: 0, max: 50000, rate: 10},
        {min: 50001, max: null, rate: 25}
    ]
}
```

### Tax Systems Supported

- **Progressive**: Multiple tax brackets with increasing rates

## 🧮 Tax Calculation Logic

### Progressive Tax Calculation

The progressive tax calculation algorithm:

1. Iterate through tax brackets in order
2. Calculate tax for each bracket based on applicable income
3. Sum total tax across all brackets
4. Calculate effective tax rate and net income

```javascript
function calculateProgressiveTax(annualIncome, brackets) {
    let totalTax = 0;
    let remainingIncome = annualIncome;

    for (let bracket of brackets) {
        // Calculate tax for current bracket
        const taxableInThisBracket = Math.min(remainingIncome, bracketSize);
        totalTax += taxableInThisBracket * (bracket.rate / 100);
        remainingIncome -= taxableInThisBracket;
    }

    return totalTax;
}
```

### Currency Conversion Flow

1. Convert input salary from input currency to local country currency
2. Calculate tax in local currency using country's tax brackets
3. Convert results back to display currency for comparison
4. Store both local and display currency amounts

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Map Visualization

Countries are color-coded using a green-to-red scale based on effective tax rate:
- **Green (#28a745)**: Tax havens (0% tax)
- **Light Green (#40c057)**: Very low tax (≤10%)
- **Green-Yellow (#69db7c)**: Low tax (≤20%)
- **Yellow (#ffeb3b)**: Moderate tax (≤30%)
- **Orange (#ff9800)**: Medium tax (≤40%)
- **Red (#f44336)**: High tax (≤50%)
- **Dark Red (#d32f2f)**: Very high tax (≤60%)
- **Deep Red (#b71c1c)**: Highest tax (>60%)
- **Neutral Gray (#9e9e9e)**: No calculation performed yet

#### Color Consistency Features:
- **Initial Load**: All markers start with neutral gray until calculations are performed
- **Persistent Colors**: Colors remain consistent during interactions (highlighting, selection)
- **Reset Behavior**: Returns to neutral gray when calculations are cleared
- **Dynamic Updates**: Colors update immediately when salary amounts change
- **Highlight Preservation**: Selected countries maintain their tax-burden colors while being highlighted

### Enhanced Unified Interactive Popups

The application features a completely standardized popup system with consistent UX design across all states:

#### Unified Design System:
- **Consistent Structure**: All popups follow the same modular layout pattern
- **Adaptive Coloring**: Headers and elements use the same green-to-red tax burden colors

## 🔄 Event System

### Component Communication

The application uses an event-driven architecture:

```javascript
// Calculator events
calculator.on('calculationComplete', handleResults);
calculator.on('calculationError', handleError);

// Table events
resultsTable.on('rowSelected', highlightCountry);

// Global events
document.addEventListener('taxCalculationsComplete', updateUI);
```

### Event Flow

1. User inputs salary → Calculator processes input
2. Calculator triggers calculation → Tax results generated
3. Results emitted → Map and table components update
4. User selects country → Map highlights and table syncs
