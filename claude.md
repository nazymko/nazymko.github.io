# Global Tax Calculator Map - Technical Documentation

## üìã Overview

The Global Tax Calculator Map is an interactive web application that allows users to visualize and compare income tax calculations across different countries worldwide. Users can input their monthly salary in various currencies and see how much tax they would pay in each country, with results displayed both on an interactive map and in a comprehensive results table.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Approach

### Component-Based Architecture

The application has been refactored into a modular, component-based architecture for better maintainability, testability, and scalability:

```
js/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application.js           # Main application coordinator
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MapComponent.js          # Interactive map functionality
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CalculatorComponent.js   # Tax calculation and input handling
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ResultsTableComponent.js # Results display and interaction
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.js                       # Application entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ taxData.js                   # Country tax bracket definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ taxCalculator.js             # Tax calculation logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ currencyService.js           # Currency conversion service
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dataProcessor.js             # Data file processing utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dataIntegrator.js            # Data integration and management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mapController.js             # Legacy map controller (deprecated)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resultsTable.js              # Legacy results table (deprecated)
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Collection**: Tax data is collected from multiple `.data` files in the `js/data/` folder
2. **Data Processing**: The `DataProcessor` class parses and validates country tax information
3. **Data Integration**: The `DataIntegrator` class merges processed data with existing tax datasets
4. **Runtime Processing**: Tax calculations are performed using the `TaxCalculator` class with real-time currency conversion

## üìä Data Structure

### Country Tax Data Format

Each country in the dataset follows this structure:

```javascript
"country_key": {
    name: "Country Name",
    currency: "CUR",
    system: "progressive|flat|zero_personal",
    countryCode: "XX",
    coordinates: [latitude, longitude],
    brackets: [
        {min: 0, max: 50000, rate: 10},
        {min: 50001, max: null, rate: 25}
    ]
}
```

### Tax Systems Supported

- **Progressive**: Multiple tax brackets with increasing rates
- **Flat**: Single tax rate for all income levels
- **Zero Personal**: No personal income tax (tax havens)

**API Used**: `https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD`

**Fallback Rates**: Comprehensive set of fallback exchange rates for major currencies

## üßÆ Tax Calculation Logic

### Progressive Tax Calculation

The progressive tax calculation algorithm:

1. Iterate through tax brackets in order
2. Calculate tax for each bracket based on applicable income
3. Sum total tax across all brackets
4. Calculate effective tax rate and net income

```javascript
function calculateProgressiveTax(annualIncome, brackets) {
    let totalTax = 0;
    let remainingIncome = annualIncome;

    for (let bracket of brackets) {
        // Calculate tax for current bracket
        const taxableInThisBracket = Math.min(remainingIncome, bracketSize);
        totalTax += taxableInThisBracket * (bracket.rate / 100);
        remainingIncome -= taxableInThisBracket;
    }

    return totalTax;
}
```

### Currency Conversion Flow

1. Convert input salary from input currency to local country currency
2. Calculate tax in local currency using country's tax brackets
3. Convert results back to display currency for comparison
4. Store both local and display currency amounts

## üìÅ Data Sources

### Processed Data Files

The application processes tax data from multiple sources:

1. **europe.data** (12 countries)
   - Major European countries including Germany, France, UK, Spain, Italy
   - Complex progressive tax systems with multiple brackets

2. **East Asia.data** (9 countries)
   - Asian countries including China, Japan, South Korea
   - Mix of progressive and flat tax systems

3. **Part 1 ‚Äì Nordic & Baltic States.data** (7 countries)
   - Nordic and Baltic countries with high-tax progressive systems
   - Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania

4. **remaining European countries.data** (28 countries)
   - Additional European countries including Ireland, Portugal, Greece
   - Diverse tax systems and rates

5. **ukraine.data** (1 country)
   - Ukraine with flat tax system plus military tax
   - Special provisions for dividends and military contributions

### Data Processing Features

- **Rate Normalization**: Converts complex rate descriptions to numeric values
- **Country Code Inference**: Automatically assigns ISO country codes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting for data issues

## üé® Visual Design

### Map Visualization

Countries are color-coded based on tax burden:
- **Blue (#45b7d1)**: Tax havens (0% tax)
- **Teal (#4ecdc4)**: Low tax (‚â§20%)
- **Light Green (#95e1d3)**: Medium-low tax (‚â§40%)
- **Orange (#ff8e53)**: Medium tax (‚â§60%)
- **Red (#ff6b6b)**: High tax (‚â§80%)
- **Dark Red (#cc2a41)**: Highest tax (>80%)

### Interactive Elements

- **Hover Effects**: Markers increase in size on hover
- **Click Interactions**: Country selection highlights markers and syncs with table
- **Popup Overlays**: Detailed tax information on marker click
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during calculations

## üîÑ Event System

### Component Communication

The application uses an event-driven architecture:

```javascript
// Calculator events
calculator.on('calculationComplete', handleResults);
calculator.on('calculationError', handleError);

// Table events
resultsTable.on('rowSelected', highlightCountry);

// Global events
document.addEventListener('taxCalculationsComplete', updateUI);
```

### Event Flow

1. User inputs salary ‚Üí Calculator processes input
2. Calculator triggers calculation ‚Üí Tax results generated
3. Results emitted ‚Üí Map and table components update
4. User selects country ‚Üí Map highlights and table syncs

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations
